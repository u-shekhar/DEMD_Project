    <h1> Content Based Movie Recommendation System </h1>
    <h2> Content Based Recommendation System : </h2>
    <h3> - This technique attempts to figure out what a user's favourite aspects of an item are and then recommends items that has those aspects. </h3>
    <p> <li> This is an implementation of content based recommender system for movies, considering only one aspect of it, the genres. </li></p>
    <p> <li> There can be various other aspects as well like particular cast, director or language to name a few. </li></p>
    <p> <li> Algorithm will figure out genres of the users' likings based on the ratings given by him or her for a few movies.</li></p>
    <p> <li> This is basically what we can call the user profile. It holds the info about which genres the user might be interested in.</li></p>
    <p> <li> Based on this user profiling, the algorithm will try to recommend the best 5 movies to the user. </li> </p>
</body>
<body>
    <h3> - The recommendation would improve as the user gives in more and more reviews as it allows to generate better user profile which in turn help the algorithm to recommend more relevant movies.</h3>

    <h2> Advantages and Disadvantages of Content-Based Recommender Systems </h2>
    <h3> Advantages </h3>
    <p> 1) Learns the user's preferences very well from already available data. </p>
    <p> 2) Can give highly personalized recommendation for users. </p>
    <h3> Disadvantages </h3>
    <p> 1) Doesn't take into account what others think of the movie, so low quality movies could also show up in the recommendations just based on genres. </p>
    <p> 2) Extracting all these data is not always feasible. </p>
    <p> 3) Determining what characteristics of the movies the user dislikes or likes is not always possible. </p>
    <p> 4) Would fail to recommend a new genre if the user never ventured into it.</p>
