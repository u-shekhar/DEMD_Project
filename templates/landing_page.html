    <h1> Content Based Movie Recommendation System </h1>
    <h2> Content Based Recommendation System : </h2>
    <h3> - This technique attempts to figure out what a user's favourite aspects of an item are and then recommends items that has those aspects. </h3>
    <p> <li> Here I'm working on content based recommender system for movies but I would be considering only one aspect of that, the genres. </li></p>
    <p> <li> There can be various other aspects as well like a particular cast or some really famous director to name a few. </li></p>
    <p> <li> I'll be trying to figure out the users' favorite genres from the movies based on the ratings given by him or her.</li></p>
    <p> <li> I'll build the user profile of the user and understand which genres the user likes the most and which genres the least based on the ratings.</li></p>
    <p> <li> Based on this user profiling, we will try to recommend best 5 movies to the user. </li> </p>

    <h3> - The recommendation would improve as the user gives in more and more reviews as it allows to generate better user profile which in turn help us to recommend more relevant movies.</h3>

    <h2> Advantages and Disadvantages of Content-Based Recommender Systems </h2>
    <h3> Advantages </h3>
    <p> 1) Learns user's preferences very well from already available data. </p>
    <p> 2) Can give highly personalized recommendation for users. </p>
    <h3> Disadvantages </h3>
    <p> 1) Doesn't take into account what others think of the movie, so low quality movies could also show up in the recommendations just based on labels. </p>
    <p> 2) Extracting all these data is not always feasible. </p>
    <p> 3) Determining what characteristics of the movies the user dislikes or likes is not always possible. </p>
    <p> 4) Would fail to recommend a new genre if the user never ventured into it and liked.</p>
